# Horiseon_Business-Development

Description

This project was developed to trouble shoot and responsibly simplify existing HTML & CSS code for a business development website by the company Horiseon.

The intent of the site is to provide more information and simplify to users’ ability to access and navigate the page for Horiseon, mainly to implement skills acquired from the site to better promote positive business development strategies. 

Some of the problems I navigated through, and resolves were in regard to the layout of the code. I consolidated and organized the code to read in an easier to read layout for the user. Combining duplicate threads of line and simplifying tags utilized in CSS to reduce line count.

I learned how to reevaluate the workflow of the website and the varying hierarchy of the HTML & CSS layout for the site. I also built on my problem-solving skills by back referencing and isolating single issues I wished to change regarding the code then systematically resolving the threads that correlated.
